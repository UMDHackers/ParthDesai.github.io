Issues holding us back on red:
•	ParthDesai.github.io: Not sure what to do for this website
•	Notes-up: MySQL not being found by php…UGH! After that I should be able to finish this.
•	Php-fun: The whiteboard doesn’t load or save, mainly we can use php-racket,but we can make a social network kind of website
•	Messaging-app: Need to make a gui for the application
•	CMD-notify: Need to run the check in the background, but maybe I could change it so it becomes shell that runs a thread for IO and a thread for checking time. Look into text-boxes in python
•	Python-alarm: Add features for adding times (One thread). And on to check time. Need a textbox.
